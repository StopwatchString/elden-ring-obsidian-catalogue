Hunter of [[Bloody Fingers]]


### Dialogue
- Under the ruins piece, first meeting
	- "Ah, you must be the new [[Tarnished]]."
	- "You'd do well to steer clear of [[Agheel Lake]], fledgling. A dragon roosts there..."
	- "And it's as fearsome as it is majestic."
	- "So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive..."
	- "stay clear of the lake."
	- "Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late."
