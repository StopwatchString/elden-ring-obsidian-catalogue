### Dialogue
- First meeting in [[Waypoint Ruins]]
	- "[[Tarnished]], are we? A wonder you should turn up here."
	- "I am Sellen, a sorcerer, quite plainly."
	- "Why are you here?"
	- >I want to learn sorcery
	- "Ahh, a yen for [[glintstone]] sorceries?"
	- "I dare say your proclivities are far from ideal..."
	- "Oh well, perhaps nurture will defy nature, with a bit of luck."
	- "But one must choose one's masters wisely."
	- "I was exiled from the [[Academy of Raya Lucaria]], as a reviled, apostate witch."
	- "Do you still wish to learn from me?"
	- >I still want to learn
	- "Well, you are a piece of work."
	- "Very well. You are now my protege in [[glintstone]] sorcery."
	- "But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never."
	- "Anticipate grievances, young apprentice."
