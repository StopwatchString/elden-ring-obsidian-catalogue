# Description

This is meant to function as a direct-transcription focused wiki of Elden Ring, however it also serves a few other functions. I am building it as I progress in my 2nd playthrough of the game, so entries are added as I encounter new information in game.

In this repo expect to find
- A listing of all items, NPCs, ideas, concepts, or just whatever you can think of in Elden Ring
- Item descriptions transcribed
- NPC dialogue transcribed
- Internal links between proper nouns, ideas, items, and locations
